Very effective for bug hunting

# What is TakeTheSubs ?

TakeTheSubs is an advanced automation tool for subdomain discovery and enumeration whether for single target or multiple targets. TakeTheSubs uses multiple reconnaissance tools for doing the subdomain gathering job in a perfect way, it can take a domains/targets list and perform the whole operation on them and after finishing the job it saves the result in a comprehensible & ordered way.

After TakeTheSubs finishes gathering subdomains it filters them from repeated subdomains then filters only the live subdomains. It also uses multiple methods to gather subdomains like: gathering subdomains through API integrations (Shodan, VirusTotal, GitHub), passive enumeration, wordlist-based enumeration and other effective techniques.

This tool is made & developed to work on modern Linux systems and has been tested on:

- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu  
- Debian

And it should work on other security distributions like:

- ParrotOS
- BackBox
- Arch Linux
